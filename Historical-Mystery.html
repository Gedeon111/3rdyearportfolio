    <h1>Entry #3 — The Mystery of Rozafa Castle</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Legend, history, and interpretations</p>

  <main>
    <section class="intro">
      <p>Rozafa Castle, overlooking the city of Shkodër in northern Albania, is one of the most iconic historical sites in the Balkans. Beyond its military and strategic importance throughout history, it is shrouded in a haunting legend. According to the tale, three brothers struggled to build the fortress: the walls collapsed each night, undoing the work of the day. Seeking guidance, they were told the structure would only stand if a human sacrifice was made. The brothers agreed to immure one of their wives, swearing not to warn them. The youngest brother kept his oath, and his wife Rozafa was chosen. Before being walled in, she begged to leave her right breast, one hand, and one foot exposed, so she could care for her newborn child. The castle finally stood firm. Even today, a milky white liquid seeps from its stones, believed by locals to be Rozafa’s milk.</p>

      <h2>Theories About the Legend</h2>
      <div class="theories">
        <div class="theory">
          <h3>Folklore and Symbolism</h3>
          <p>The story of Rozafa is seen as a metaphor for sacrifice, motherhood, and the endurance of the Albanian people. It represents how personal suffering can contribute to the survival of the community. Passed down through oral tradition, the legend reinforces cultural identity and collective memory.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="theory">
          <h3>Historical Context</h3>
          <p>Some historians suggest the legend reflects the harsh realities of medieval construction and the symbolic importance of women’s roles in family and society. Sacrificial myths were common in the Balkans and may have been adapted to explain unexplained structural challenges in building the fortress.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="theory">
          <h3>Scientific Explanation</h3>
          <p>The mysterious white liquid seeping from the walls is most likely caused by water passing through limestone, carrying minerals like calcium carbonate. When it dries, it creates a white residue that locals interpreted as “milk.” This natural phenomenon gave credibility to the legend over centuries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="theory">
          <h3>Mythological Parallels</h3>
          <p>Similar myths of immurement exist across the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The Rozafa story may be part of a wider mythological tradition where sacrifice ensures stability — linking Albanian folklore to broader regional beliefs.</p>

    <section class="stance">
      <h2>My Stance</h2>
      <p>I find the legend of Rozafa Castle both tragic and inspiring. It captures the deep cultural values of sacrifice, loyalty, and resilience. While I admire the folklore and recognize its importance to Albanian heritage, I personally believe the scientific explanation — mineral-rich water creating the white residue — best explains the physical mystery. Still, the legend remains invaluable as a story that connects generations and preserves a unique cultural identity.</p>
